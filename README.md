# Enhanced React Calculator

## Original Project
This project is based on the [React Calculator](https://github.com/ahfarmer/calculator) created by Andrew H. Farmer. The original calculator implements basic arithmetic operations with a clean React implementation.

## Added Features

### 1. Calculation History

The history panel allows users to:
- View a log of all previous calculations
- Click on any previous calculation to load its result
- Toggle the history panel open and closed

**Implementation Details:**
- Created a new `History` component with collapsible UI
- Added state management for calculation history in the App component
- Added logic to track and display calculation expressions
- Implemented UI for easy access to previous calculations

### 2. Theme Switcher

The theme switcher allows users to:
- Toggle between light and dark themes
- Persist theme preference across browser sessions
- Reduce eye strain when using the calculator at night

**Implementation Details:**
- Created a new `ThemeToggle` component
- Implemented CSS variables for theming
- Added localStorage persistence for user preferences
- Created comprehensive dark theme styling

## Implementation Process

### 1. Project Setup
I began by forking and cloning the repository, then installing all dependencies. After ensuring the project ran successfully, I analyzed the codebase structure to understand how it worked.

### 2. Feature Planning
I created detailed plans for each feature, identifying which files would need to be modified and what new components would need to be created.

### 3. Implementation with Aider
Using Aider, I implemented the features one by one:

- First, I created the History component and integrated it into the App
- Then, I implemented the theme switcher functionality
- Finally, I added theme persistence using localStorage

### 4. Testing and Refinement
After implementing the basic features, I:
- Manually tested all functionality
- Fixed bugs and UI issues discovered during testing
- Wrote unit tests for the new components
- Made refinements based on user experience considerations

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: History Panel Positioning
**Problem:** Initially, the history panel would push content instead of overlaying it.
**Solution:** Used absolute positioning with a z-index to create an overlay effect.

### Challenge 2: Theme Persistence
**Problem:** Theme settings weren't persisting after page refresh.
**Solution:** Implemented localStorage for theme persistence and initialized the theme on page load.

### Challenge 3: Calculation Expression Formatting
**Problem:** Building history expressions from state was challenging.
**Solution:** Created a system to track operations and build readable expressions before saving to history.

## Aider Commands Used

Throughout the implementation, I used various Aider commands:

1. `/add` - To add files to Aider's context
2. `/ask` - To ask questions about the codebase
3. `/edit` - To edit files with Aider's assistance
4. `/ls` - To list available files
5. `/diff` - To review changes before committing
6. `/run` - To run the development server
7. `/test` - To run unit tests
8. `/commit` - To commit changes with meaningful messages

## Future Improvements

- Add ability to clear history
- Implement more themes beyond just light and dark
- Add keyboard shortcuts for calculations
- Create an export function for calculation history

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-calculator.git
